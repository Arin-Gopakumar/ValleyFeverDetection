# Valley Fever Dust Density Prediction

## Overview
This project develops a deep learning model to predict high or low dust density in satellite images, aiming to assist in Valley Fever risk assessment.

## Model
Utilizes a custom implementation of the AlexNet architecture trained on a labeled dataset of satellite images categorized into 'High Dust' and 'Low Dust'.

## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
- Train the model using `model.py`.
- Predict dust density in new images with `main.py`.

## Dataset
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, located in 'train' and 'test' directories, respectively.
